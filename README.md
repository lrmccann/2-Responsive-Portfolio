Read Me for Homework 2

For each of my web pages I used the navbar from Bootstrap and customized it by removing several buttons and adding my name to the top left corner. I also used the contact info code from bootstrap and removed several buttons before customizing the borders and  floating the text. I utilized the grid system when creating the index.html and the contact.html but struggled with the portfolio.html, having the borders of all but two of my <div col-6>’s float too far on either side of the screen ( I would really like some help on this next time we get some office hours). I then ran it through the html checker and corrected things like: language, meta charset, and </li>’s. I am currently working on getting the website live as only my index.html is live at https://lrmccann.github.io/Responsive-Portfolio/#

I’ve also added my html and css documents on my google drive
